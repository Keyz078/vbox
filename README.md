These scripts are for start and stop virtualbox vms, instead opening virtualbox
These scripts are still on development, any bugs or error it's will be nice to report to us.

How to:
- Download the scripts
- Change the permission (chmod +x <scripts>)
- Copy to /usr/bin/ so that script can work
- Enjoy the script

Thank you!!
